  Kiev cutlets Recipe

Ingredients:

    2 large chicken breasts
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
    1 teaspoon lemon juice
    Salt and black pepper, to taste
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    2 eggs, beaten
    1 cup breadcrumbs (panko or regular)
    1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)
    Vegetable oil (for frying)

Instructions:

1.    Prepare the garlic butter: In a small bowl, mix the softened butter with garlic, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Shape the butter into a small log, wrap in plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 30 minutes.

2.    Prepare the chicken: Butterfly each chicken breast by slicing it in half horizontally, but not all the way through. Open it like a book and pound it gently to an even thickness, about 1/4 inch (5-6 mm).

3.    Wrap the butter: Place a piece of the frozen garlic butter in the center of each chicken breast. Fold the sides over and roll tightly, sealing the butter inside. Secure with toothpicks if necessary.

4.    Coat the chicken: Dredge each chicken roll in flour, then dip into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it in breadcrumbs. Repeat the egg and breadcrumb coating for a crispier crust.

5.    Chill: Place the coated chicken rolls in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to help them hold their shape.

6.    Fry the chicken: Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Fry the chicken rolls for about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown.

7.    Bake (optional but recommended): Transfer the fried chicken to a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) and bake for 10-15 minutes to ensure the inside is fully cooked.

8.    Serve: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot with mashed potatoes or a fresh salad.
